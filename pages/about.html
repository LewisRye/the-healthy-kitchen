        <h2 class="mb-3">About</h2>
        <p>
          This website promotes healthy food choices by simulating an
          interactive 3D kitchen. It showcases detailed models of nutritious
          foods with educational insights and visual appeal.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility has been considered for this website. An example of this is
          the responsive design, that UI when you resize the window or use the 
          page on mobile. The friendly design means this website can run on nearly
          any device. For disability issues, I have made buttons very large with an
          appropriate colour scheme for people with vision issues.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Design</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns,
          this application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
        </p>
        <h4>Model - Backend API</h4>
        <p>
          ExpressJS was chosen for its simplicity and minimalistic design
          which is perfect for creating small APIs quickly. The point
          of this API is to serve nutrition information about the different
          foods. This backend API communicates with an SQLite database to store
          the data, and is accessed in the frontend via HTTP GET requests.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/nutritional-information.png" style="width: 33%;">
        <img src="/images/api.png" style="width: 33%;">
        <img src="/images/http-get.png" style="width: 33%;">

        <h4>View - Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>
          Bootstrap 5 was selected for its robust grid system. The consistent
          dark theme enhances readability and visual appeal, while Bootstrap's
          grid system ensure that the application looks and functions well on
          all devices, including on mobile.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/mobile.png" style="width: 25%;">

        <h4>Controller - Three.JS</h4>
        <p>
          Three.JS was selected as the core rendering engine for the 3D graphics
          in the application. The decision to use Three stems from its performance
          and ease of use to create good 3D scenes with animations.

                  The fridge opens and closes interactively, revealing foods inside.
                  Animations and sound effects enhance realism. There are also glass shelves
                  inside the fridge that are transparent, making it a more detailed mesh
                  with realistic properties.

                  has been drawn in Blender to include slight brown spots,
                  enhancing realism involving the ripeness of the banana.
                  The banana can also be cut in half by the user, increasing
                  interactivity.

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">3D App Implementation</h2>
        <h4>Design Quality and Usability</h4>
        <p>The site makes use of Bootstrap's row and column grid layout
          to ensure responsiveness across devices, such as mobile, and consistent
          UI appearance/behaviour. Bootstrap and CSS are also used to style the
          buttons and navigation bars. The site is made more usable by the
          tooltips that are shown when you hover over something that is clickable.
        </p>

        <h4>Animations</h4>
        <p>
          Animations can be triggered through clicking objects. For example, the
          fridge will open when clicked, and the banana will cut in half. There
          are also buttons such as 'Toggle Wireframe' that the user can use to
          see the wireframe version of the models.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/banana-cut.png" style="width: 50%;">

        <h4>Textures</h4>
        <p>
          Another interesting feature is the 'Redecorate' button, this switches
          the textures being used on the walls, floor and door and simulates a
          total redecoration of the kitchen. 
        </p>
        <img src="/images/texture1.png" style="width: 33%;">
        <img src="/images/texture2.png" style="width: 33%;">
        <img src="/images/texture3.png" style="width: 33%;">

        <h4>Audio and Sound Effects</h4>
        <p>
          All sound effects are copyright-free and sourced from
          <a href="https://www.mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/" class="text-info"
            >Mixkit</a
          >. The sound effects I have chosen to include are played when opening and
          closing the fridge, as well as the light switch being toggled, you can try
          out these sounds by clicking the fridge or the light switch.
        </p>

        <h4>Lighting</h4>
        <p>
          Lighting is also controlled by buttons. There is a light switch found
          on the wall that can turn the scene from day into night, and this turns
          off the sunlight, and turns on a spotlight in the ceiling and puts stars
          in the sky outside, simulating night time.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/day.png">
        <img src="/images/night.png">

        <h4>Interaction with 3D Models</h4>
        <p>JavaScript is used to manipulate the 3D models, this is through the camera
          panning when the user moves the mouse, and when animations are triggered upon
          clicking an object.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Interesting Features</h2>
        <h4>Drawing Model Textures</h4>
        <p>
          The models I have created in Blender are of sufficient complexity, with
          correct roughness and metallic properties. I have created the
          textures myself using the 'Texture Paint' tool.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/texture-paint.png" style="width: 50%;">

        <h4>GitHub Archive</h4>
        <p>
          This project is version-controlled using Git, with full commit history
          available on the <a
          href="https://www.github.com/lewisrye/the-healthy-kitchen"
          target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>jQuery</h4>
        <p>
          jQuery handles dynamic interactivity such as showing and hiding
          buttons during interactions, an example of this is the 'Close Fridge'
          button that only shows when the fridge is open.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Testing</h2>
        <h4>Interaction</h4>
        <p>
          Interactive elements were tested thoroughly, and are working correctly.
          Examples of interactivity include the fridge, which opens and closes,
          the light switch, which can be toggled by the user, and the cupboards
          which take the user to a chopping board scene where they can cut open
          a banana.
        </p>
        <p>Upon testing the opening of the fridge, I found that you could click
          other elements that should not be clicked, such as the light switch.
          This was fixed by disabling all other buttons when the fridge was open.
        </p>
        <p>Found below is a testing video that shows all working interactions.
